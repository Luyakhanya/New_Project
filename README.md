# TransRocket

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 

The purpose of the project entitled as "TransRocket" is to computerize the Reavaya to develop software which is user friendly simple, fast, and cost-effective. It deals with the collection of passenger's information, login details etc. Traditionally it was done manually. The main function of the system is to register and store passenger's details and bus drivers details and retrieve these details as and when required, and also manipulate the details meaningfully system input contains passengers's details.

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* use of more than two cards by one client/passenger
* problem 2
* Identification of client card
* view bus destination


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

TransRocket can be accessed by entering your username and password, passengers and drivers are responsible for this. It is accessible either by an administrator or receptionist, only they can add data into the database. The data can be retrieved easily.
The data are well protected for personal use makes the data processing very fast.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:


This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

Other south Africans who  don't have an Identity documents and foreigners without a visa.

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 

Stay focused on the main Goal.
Improve project planning and quality.
Stay in touch with the group-more often.
Communicate with the customer three times a week.
Help team members' tasks.
